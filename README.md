# 👋 Hey, I’m Ernest Villacota  
*(also known as **MrOutput**)*

🎓 Electronics Engineering student who loves building things — whether it’s a game, a tool, or just some random experiment that popped into my head.  
I spend a lot of my time making Roblox projects, small web apps, and tinkering with electronics.

## 🛠 What I’ve Been Into
- 🎮 **Roblox Development** — roleplay games, RTS ideas, survival sandboxes… I enjoy systems that feel alive and flexible.  
- ⚡ **Side Projects** — POS systems, IoT dashboards, and random utilities that make my life easier.  
- 🧩 **Problem Solving** — I weirdly enjoy debugging and figuring out why something isn’t working.

---

## 🧰 Tech & Tools I Use
- **Technologies:** Roblox Studio, Rojo, Python  
- **Languages:** Lua, Luau, JavaScript, Node.js, Basic HTML/CSS  
- **Frameworks:** Matter, ECS, Knit, React-Lua  
- **Paradigms:** ECS, OOP, Imperative, Declarative  

I also make external tools when needed — for example, I once built a Perlin noise previewer so I could experiment with procedural terrain for my Roblo game without running a Roblox game instance in Studio every time.
